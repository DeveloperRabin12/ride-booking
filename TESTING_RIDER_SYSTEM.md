# Testing the Rider Notification System

## Prerequisites

1. **Backend is running on port 4000**
2. **Frontend is running on port 5173 (Vite default)**
3. **MongoDB is running and connected**

## Step-by-Step Testing Guide

### 1. **Start the Backend**

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

**Expected output**: `Server is running on port 4000`

### 2. **Start the Frontend**

```bash
cd Frontend
npm run dev
```

**Expected output**: Vite dev server running on localhost:5173

### 3. **Test Backend API (Optional)**

```bash
cd backend
node test-rider-api.js
```

This will test all rider API endpoints and show if they're working correctly.

### 4. **Test Rider Registration and Login**

#### **Step 4a: Access Rider Registration**

1. Open browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Click **"Become a Rider"** button
3. Fill in the registration form:
   - First Name: `Test`
   - Last Name: `Rider`
   - Email: `testrider@example.com`
   - Password: `password123`
   - Vehicle Color: `Red`
   - Vehicle Plate: `TEST123`
   - Vehicle Type: `Car`
4. Click **"Register"**

**Expected result**: Redirected to rider login page

#### **Step 4b: Login as Rider**

1. On the rider login page, enter:
   - Email: `testrider@example.com`
   - Password: `password123`
2. Click **"Log In"**

**Expected result**: Redirected to `/riderHome` with rider dashboard

### 5. **Verify Rider Connection**

#### **Step 5a: Check Browser Console**

Open browser console (F12) and look for:

```
‚úÖ Connected to server with socket ID: [socket-id]
RiderHome - Current rider data: [rider-object]
RiderHome - Socket connected: true
```

#### **Step 5b: Check Connection Status**

On the rider home page, look for:

- **üü¢ Connected** indicator in top-right corner
- **üìç Location sent: [lat], [lng]** messages in console

#### **Step 5c: Check Backend Console**

Look for these messages:

```
Rider [id] joining as rider with socket [socket-id]
Rider [id] socket ID updated to [socket-id] and status set to active
Rider [id] location updated: [lat], [lng]
```

### 6. **Test Notifications**

#### **Step 6a: Create a Ride Request**

1. Open a new browser tab
2. Go to `http://localhost:5173`
3. Click **"Start as Passenger"**
4. Login/register as a user
5. Go to home page and create a ride request:
   - Enter pickup location (e.g., "New York")
   - Enter destination (e.g., "Brooklyn")
   - Select vehicle type (car or bike)
   - Click create ride

#### **Step 6b: Check Rider Notification**

1. Go back to the rider tab
2. Look for:
   - **"New ride received"** message in console
   - Ride popup appearing at bottom of screen
   - Backend console showing:
     ```
     Searching for riders within 5km of [lat], [lng]
     Found [count] active riders in radius
     Sending notification to rider [id] at socket [socket-id]
     ```

### 7. **Test Ride Confirmation**

#### **Step 7a: Accept Ride**

1. On the rider's ride popup, click **"Accept Ride"**
2. Check backend console for confirmation

#### **Step 7b: Verify User Notification**

1. Go back to user tab
2. Look for ride confirmation message

## Troubleshooting

### **If Rider Can't Connect:**

1. Check if backend is running on port 4000
2. Check browser console for connection errors
3. Verify MongoDB connection
4. Check if rider has valid location coordinates

### **If Notifications Don't Work:**

1. Verify rider status is 'active' in database
2. Check if rider has valid socketId
3. Verify rider location is within search radius
4. Check backend logs for errors

### **If Location Updates Fail:**

1. Ensure browser has location permissions
2. Check if navigator.geolocation is available
3. Verify location update interval (should be 10 seconds)

### **Common Error Messages:**

- **"Socket.io is not initialized"**: Backend socket not running
- **"No riders found in radius"**: Increase search radius or check rider locations
- **"Rider has no socket ID"**: Rider not properly connected to socket

## Expected Console Output

### **Frontend Console (Rider):**

```
‚úÖ Connected to server with socket ID: abc123
RiderHome - Current rider data: {_id: "123", fullname: {...}, ...}
RiderHome - Socket connected: true
üìç Location sent: 40.7128, -74.0060
New ride received: {_id: "456", pickup: "New York", ...}
```

### **Backend Console:**

```
Client connected: abc123
User 123 joining as rider with socket abc123
Rider 123 socket ID updated to abc123 and status set to active
Rider 123 location updated: 40.7128, -74.0060
Searching for riders within 5km of (40.7128, -74.0060)
Found 1 active riders in radius
Sending notification to rider 123 at socket abc123
```

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Rider can register and login  
‚úÖ Rider connects to socket successfully  
‚úÖ Rider location updates every 10 seconds  
‚úÖ Rider receives ride notifications  
‚úÖ Rider can accept rides  
‚úÖ User receives ride confirmation  
‚úÖ All backend logs show successful operations

If all these criteria are met, the rider notification system is working correctly!
